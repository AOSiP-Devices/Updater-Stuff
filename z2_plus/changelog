Device specific changes:
Device and vendor repos rebased again over zuk-devs
Added back call recording support, Pixel vibration pattern, Always-On Display support, Pixel perf stack and powerhal for EAS, and aptX blobs
Kernel repo again rebased over android-linux-stable (which has latest linux-stable and CAF tags merged)
Dropped a lot of unnecessary commits, reworked few to make them right
Kernel is debloated heavily and debugging is reduced a lot (major thanks to sultanxda and SODP for the commits)
(Battery life should be a bit better as debugging and other bloats take up a lot of CPU cycles)
Enabled Clang LTO which provides a tiny performance bump
