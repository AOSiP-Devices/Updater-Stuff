Device specific changes:
* Kernel repo rebased over and adjusted for latest CAF 8996 tag
  Notable fixes from the new tag:
- Memory latency table for 8996
  Memlat governor increases DDR bandwith upon increase in CPU frequencies as per the table
- PAN emulation, a security feature
- Added support for AVS version check
  With this we don't need the hack to fix hi-res audio
* Added CAF's Bluetooth sepolicy patch otherwise BT is broken with the latest kernel CAF tag
* Simple LMK updates
